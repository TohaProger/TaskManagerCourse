Each project can contain multiple cards, and each card can hold several tasks. The application is designed for effective project organization, allowing users to easily track tasks and their statuses.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **ASP.NET Core**
- **Entity Framework**
- Future plans include:
  - **HTML** rendering for web-based interaction
  - **JavaScript** for enhanced functionality and user interaction

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports login and registration functionality to manage access control.
- **Project Management**: Users can create and manage projects.
- **Card Management**: Within each project, users can create and manage cards that represent task categories.
- **Task Management**: Within each card, users can add tasks with relevant information (e.g., description, deadline, priority).
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for users, projects, cards, and tasks.

## Installation

Details about the installation process are still being refined as the project is in active development. However, the application will be hosted on a server, accessible through a web browser. Depending on the implementation, it could be hosted either on a local network or on the internet for remote access.

## System Requirements

- **.NET 8.0** (for the backend server-side functionality)
- **Browser** (any modern browser to access the application)

The application is intended to work on various devices, including PCs (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets).

## Current Development Status

The project is still under development, and some features might be incomplete. A fully functional version **1.0** is not yet available, but progress is being made towards the release of a stable version soon.
